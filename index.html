                They say some people have a certain kind of gravitational pull—the kind that makes you stop
                and notice. You possess that, Zeba. Wishing a woman of effortless grace and captivating
                charm a truly unforgettable day.
                <br><br>
                May this year bring you as much joy as you accidentally bring to everyone who crosses your path.
                Cheers to your light.

                <p>— If I were a poet, I’d try to capture your elegance in a sonnet. Since I’m not, I’ll just say this: I hope your next trip around the sun involves coffee, conversation, and maybe running into me. 😉</p>
